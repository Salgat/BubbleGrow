This document holds an informal list of work planned to do.
	- X Add resource player subclass
		- Simply holds (and possibly creates?) resources on the map, which are units that can be mined
	- Implement gathering resources
		- Having an issue where the unit should be gathering but just sitting still
	- Correct size to distance, since they aren't proportional.
	- Add controls to move
	- Add basic player AI (for computer opponents)

Later,
	- Artwork
	- Menu
	- Sounds

Way later...
	- Networking (servers and clients)
	
	
Notes:
	- Have mouse movement (distance from center point) toggle-able by pressing space bar (to let players click buttons).
